  * [Python MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/)
  * [slackclient](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient)
* An SQL Server
  * If you are using MySQL, the Authentication Method **MUST** be the Legacy Version. PDO does not support the use of `caching_sha2_password` Authentication. 
* A Neucore Instance

* A Slack Workspace
  * Plus a Slack app (with bot) with the appropriate roles as listed in `config.ini`

## Running the Checker

  You can also use environment variables instead of modifying config.ini. For dev env copy .env.dist to 
  .env and execute `source ./.env`
